1941-12-07, was the winter of our discontent,
a date that will live in infamy.
Made glorious summer by the moon on 1968-07-20.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the bosom of the deep ocean scheduled for 1986-01-28.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths.
It was 1929-10-29, when the stock market crashed.
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.
The wall came down on 1989-11-09, 
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries.
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
1945-08-06, the dawn of the Atomic Age began.
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
when many people died on 2001-09-11, when the towers fell.
